# Credit card Fraud Visualization

As online shopping and bill paying has skyrocketed in popularity, there is no longer a need to possess a physical credit card or debit card to make purchases, and it is possible even to open a financial account, and obtain credit cards solely through online transactions. Because of this, criminals able to obtain enough personal information about other individuals may use that information to commit credit card fraud transactions. 

The credit card fraud problem includes modelling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. The aim here is to detect and visualize the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

1. Credit Card Fraud Detection Based on Machine Learning :
Dr.Kanchana M, Vandita Chadda, Harshit Jain 2020 International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology , Credit Card Fraud Detection Based on Machine learning.
Introduction : In this paper, they depict Random forest calculation relevant on Find extortion location. They portray exhaustively and their precision 91.96% and 96.77% separately and furthermore this paper sum up second sort is superior to the principal type. Many managed AI calculations apply on 70% preparing and 30% testing dataset. Arbitrary woods, stacking classifier, XGB classifier, SVM, Decision tree, nave Bayes, and KNN calculations are looked at, with 94.59 percent, 95.27 percent, 93.24 percent, 90.87 percent, 90.54 percent, and 94.25 percent, individually.
Gaps identified in the survey : Here , they have shown that AdaBoost calculation is superior to different calculations. However, we need a high computational force, unsatisfactory for continuous tasks. Also, retraining is needed for new sorts of misrepresentation cases.
Results : Sum up of this paper, SVM has the most elevated positioning with The stacking classifier gets the least appraising with 0.0335 FPR and 0.5360 FPR. and furthermore they depict stream diagram of misrepresentation recognition measure. for example information Acquisition, information pre-handling, Exploratory information investigation and techniques or calculations are exhaustively. Calculations are K-closest neighbor (KNN), irregular tree, AdaBoost and Logistic relapse exactness are 96.91%, 94.32%, 57.73% and 98.24% individually.

2. Credit Card Fraud Detection using Classification, Unsupervised, Neural Networks Models.
Introduction : Credit card frauds are ones committed with the purpose of gaining money through deception without the cardholder's awareness. The following methods can be used to commit credit card fraud:
(A) Fake IDs: This type of fraud involves exploiting other people's personal information without their permission.
(B) Skimming Method: A gadget known as a "skimmer" is installed at ATM machines to commit this form of fraud. When the card is swiped, the data on the magnetic stripe of the card is acquired.
(C) Card not present: When a fraudster takes card data such as the expiration date and account number, they can use the card without physically possessing it.
(D) False businessperson sites: This sort of fraud is carried out via the Phishing method, in which the perpetrators establish a website/webpage that appears to be identical to the actual site. It is incredibly difficult to detect fraud. Fraud detection algorithms confront a number of obstacles, including the necessity to detect fraud in a short amount of time and the requirement to handle a high number of parameters while training. In our article, we compared the strategies to see which one delivers the best results under what situations. To obtain high accuracy rates and speed up the identification process, ‚ÄúLogistic Regression,‚Äù ‚ÄúK-Means,‚Äù and ‚ÄúConvolution Neural Networks algorithms‚Äù are utilised. ‚ÄúConvolution Neural Networks‚Äù are used to detect underlying patterns that have previously been followed, resulting in greater efficiency.
Results:  The Logistic Regression model performed effectively on our dataset, as evidenced by the model results. The Neural Networks model, which has more hidden layers than the Logistic regression model, is the next better model after that. On our dataset, the K-Means model performs poorly. On an unstructured dataset, this K-Means model performs well. There are many more contributions to our project in addition to our model, the most prevalent of which is the Random Forest model, which also performs quite well. As a result, using the binary classification procedure, the Logistic Regression model performs well on the credit card fraud dataset.

3. Machine Learning Approaches for Credit Card Fraud Detection
Introduction: The predictive model assigns a high or low risk of fraud to each transaction, with those with a high risk receiving notifications. Investigators examine these warnings and provide comment for each one, indicating whether it is a real positive (fraud) or a false positive (fraud) (genuine). The model can then be improved as a result of the feedback. Expert rules, or rules based on expertise from fraud experts, can be used to build a prediction model, but they require manual tuning and human supervision.
Alternatively, we may use Machine Learning (ML) approaches to quickly identify fraudulent patterns and anticipate transactions that are most likely to be fraudulent. On the basis of a set of instances, machine learning techniques infer a prediction model. In most situations, the model is a parametric function that predicts the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent based on a set of features describing the transaction. For starters, they enable pattern identification in high-dimensional data streams, in which transactions arrive in a continuous stream and each transaction is defined by a large number of variables. Second, both time and space are frequently linked in fraudulent transactions.
Results : To categorize a transaction as fraudulent or valid, four fraud detection models were developed using decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network techniques. Their performance was assessed using three parameters. The findings revealed that no single data mining methodology is uniformly superior to others. Developing a fraud detection model employing a combination of different data mining approaches could help enhance performance (ensemble).
